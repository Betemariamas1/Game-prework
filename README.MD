## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
[YOUR ANSWER HERE]
I followed resources from https://courses.codepath.org/snippets/summer_internship_for_tech_excellence/prework#heading-11-submitting-your-work
and i used https://w3schoools.com to further read while doing the project

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[YOUR ANSWER HERE]
One was in the level of details. Debugging the program proved to be challenging. In a way, glitch identifies missing partenthesis or undefined variables, but debugging the line of codes that made the page unresponsive or identifying which one it was. I read/researched resources and approach it better.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[YOUR ANSWER HERE]
Some would be about making websites more interactive like an approach similar to virtual environments on some websites in addiition to prefereable usage of colors in websites.
In  terms of coding, what would be a more systematic way to make the codes organized better? If there is a similar approach like object oriented programming in python for eg.


4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[YOUR ANSWER HERE]

I was working on decreasing the delay to as the difficulty increased, i would work on that. In addition i would have added a different background(would be a self-made photoshop design related to the context of the game)
